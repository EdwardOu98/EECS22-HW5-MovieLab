This program, according to the command line input, has two input mode: 
1)-i: Take an image input
2)-m: Take a movie input
If the input is an image, a filter will be applied to it iteratively. And then
all the images produced by the iterative filter will be made into a movie. 
If the input is a movie, it will be reversed by the ReverseImageList Function, 
and then the reversed movie will be the output movie. 
Functions: 
Create/DeleteImageList: Allocate/Deallocate memory space for an image list using
malloc/free function. 
Create/DeleteImageEntry: Allocate/Deallocate memory space for an image entry
using malloc/free function
doIterativeFilter: It has five parameters: 1)Image, 2)Filter, 3)Start value, 
4)End value, 5)Step value. The image parater accept an RGBImage as input, the 
start/end/step values are given by the command line tools. It does not matter 
if start>end or start<end. It can do either way. The filter is also feed in by
command line tools. It will be applied to the image for n times, where n is 
defined by the start/end/step values. 
ReverseImageList: This function reverses the order of an input image list. It
first check if the current entry is the first or the last entry in the list. If
it is the first entry, it sets the Prev pointer pointing to the adress that the
Next vector points to, and then sets the Prev pointer pointing to NULL. If it is
the last entry, it first sets its Next pointer pointing to the adress that the
Prev pointer points to, and then set the Prev pointer to NULL. If it is any 
other entry, it reverses the Prev and Next Pointer. After it has gone through
every single entry in the list, it reverses the First and Last pointer.
